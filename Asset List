Scripts(Bosses):
  Note(Oracle): 2 possible methods for creating bosses at this juncture. Either a shell that can be given all the attributes
  of a boss but has movement and basic behaviours already imprinted, or hand-coding each boss individually. At this point,
  hand-coding each boss is the way to go.

Scripts(Bullet Wrapper):
  - Forward Movement based on ROT
  - ROT adjustment per pattern, passed from script
  - Easy-Input pattern wrapper
